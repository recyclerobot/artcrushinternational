                <p>Join us on conceptual/installation/social practice artist Michele Pred's red couch in her white-walled studio at Faultline Artspace in East Oakland, California. Pred is a Swedish-American artist who started the "Art of Equal Pay" movement to encourage female and non-binary artists to charge more. She's got a billboard in New York City all about it. With us, she talks about the "Power of the Purse" series, a collection of vintage purses that blink light-up political messages. Does your purse do that? Not yet. Her couch is from IKEA and her work is from the heart.</p>

<h2 class="align-center">Transcription of Michele Pred's interview</h2>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: Svea Vikander</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: Michele Pred</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">BS: Bud Snow</span></p>
<p class="p1">__</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>Italicized lines are Svea's voice over</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">[industrial sounds]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: <i>I take the BART to Fruitvale and walk 10 minutes east. </i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: The building is like big, warehouse, it's grey, painted grey, it says FAULTLINE ART SPACE on the side. The building next to it has this huge American flag, really blowing in the wind.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: <i>I check my Instagram messages for my top-secret mission instructions</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: 'If you've never been to Faultline before, give me a text when you arrive and I'll come down and meet you.' OK... I'm texting her, I'm saying 'Hi Michele, I'm here at the red gate!' </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: <i>J-Fine has taken the day off in protest against American capitalism and my general flakiness so, you know, you’re stuck with me. I should let you know that Jozefien exerts a calming, pacifying influence on me and without her I am… less patient.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: [laughing] She says, 'Go around the other side if you have been here and know where it is, I'll meet you there.' I said, 'I haven't but I can likely find it, I am good at finding.' This is ridiculous, she should just be here. Yeah, you should be coming down to meet me. [laughter] So she says she's coming but she has to go 'kissa' real quick, 'if you know what that means,' she says. 'Kissa' means 'pee'. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>SV: How could I be mad at a fellow Swede, with her unflappable natural confidence in her bodily functions?</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">[truck sounds] [train horn]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: <i>Suddenly, the big metal gate slides open. </i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: Ok so there was a truck leaving so I just went in through the back gate. [train horn] Oh, there's a train!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: <i>And there she is! </i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">[Michele laughing]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: Hey! Hi!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: <i>Side note, it was kind of my fault, she had given me the address to the front door of Faultline. But I came on BART and approached it by the back door. Though I mean, to be fair, it’s not always easy to tell what’s the front or the back of a warehouse, right?</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">[climbing metal stairs]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: So, do you speak some Swedish?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: I don't speak much.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: But you know what 'kissa' means. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: Yeah. But my dad is Swedish, he's a Swedish immigrant, so...It's nice to have the Swedish artist connection.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: I know!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: I often meet Swedes who are not artists and it never seems to work. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: I know [laughter] I know, I know. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: Right? Right?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: <i>Michele walks me through the open-concept central portion of the warehouse, where several counter-height work tables are pushed together. </i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: This is awesome, I love this space. Very communal, I like it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: Yeah, it is. And like, everyone starts showing up in the afternoon or midday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: Yeah yeah</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: So usually there's more people...</span><i></i></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>SV: There are two bathrooms (pretty clean!), a kitchen area, with about 10 studios leading off toward the windows, separated by low walls. Very few doors. We walk back into her studio space, which is one of the larger ones and is in the back right corner.</i></span><i></i></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: So I've been in this space for a couple of years, after I had a child in 2009 I always had a space at home. And when I moved in with my now husband we converted a two car garage. And it just didn't have enough light for me. And I needed light. And I love light. It just invigorates me. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And then I found this space here, in East Oakland. And I love it. It's a corner space with 12-foot-high windows, lots of windows. One side facing the Oakland hills. One side facing some trees but also looking onto the 880 and you can hear the traffic. It's right next to the train tracks and so you feel life. You hear the sirens and then you can also look at the hills and see the blue sky. And so I love love love this space. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Um, I actually often work from the couch. It's just something, it just feels so relaxing. Obviously some things, many things I have to work from a table, I have several work tables in here. But some of the work I can do from my couch and it's so... It just makes me happy. A red couch in the middle of the white space with huge white walls.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: <i>And where is it from?</i></span><i></i></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: IKEA! [laughter] Swedish! I have one long wall where I sort of rotate art pieces around and have a lot of my "Power of the Purse" series up here, I have some of my feminist riot shields and I rotate for inspiration and to see how things look together. And again, it's an environment that makes you feel really inspired, to have the work up, kind of rotate it, it's kind of like a gallery wall. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: <i>I just imagine this being so legitimizing! So motivating!</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: I, yeah! Yeah. Yeah. Up here almost right above your head is called "Travelers," it is an umbrella hanging about eight feet up in the air with scissors raining down underneath it, from the "Confiscated" series, the airport confiscated series. I love the reference to surrealism, all that an umbrella can imply, I've used them a lot. So, very interactive, people wanna touch them and stand underneath them and it's powerful to have this raining down of the scissors. I also have one with bullets. It's not up right now.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is a voting booth, I've made several pieces with voting booths. This one's just waiting until I can have time to get to it. But I've put neon pink sequin fabric over it. I just love the combination. I'm not quite sure what's going to happen with it yet but um, it is gonna be for my show in New York this fall. It's really amazing, this is actually the original curtain on it, a red white and blue striped curtain. Yes. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV:<i> I ask Michele to tell me about the thousands of sharp objects arranged in a 5-foot donut-like circle on her studio floor.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: My work, actually, is a lot about the experience or process of the hunt, the find, the discovery. I've been getting a lot of attention for the "Power of the Purse" series, and which I've of course been excited about. But I think a lot of people don't know about my full breadth of work, at this point. This piece is called "Encirclement". These items were confiscated from the airport after 9/11. They're all scissors and razor blades and corkscrews and plastic guns and matches, formed into a circle that's about 5 feet in diameter. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And I work a lot with found objects that are embedded with many, many layers of meaning. That's what's exciting for me, about an object, is taking it and dissecting it. What it signifies and culture, sharp objects were suddenly confiscated from people at airports of course represent many things, including what all of a sudden is determined to be a weapon in our society. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There's sentimental value in these items. There's globalization. Travel. Where people live, where people are going. There's cork screws from Napa valley and matches from Japan. And there's razor blades from Germany in there. And I see it as a time capsule of a time in our history that's still happening, we're still having items confiscated at the airport. </span><i></i></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>SV: I know you're wondering how she got all these things, right? Turns out, Michele was a limo driver. She spent a lot of her break time knocking on doors at the SFO airport. And eventually they just gave in and gave her all these contraband objects. She also has some magazines out on the table—there’s Vanity Fair with her purse on the front; there’s VOGUE, fancy things like that, but the one I’m interested in?</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: Oh wow!</span><i></i></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: This I had to show, I just pulled it out, I just pulled out quickly some things—</span><i></i></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>SV: Is the IKEA staff newsletter.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: It's translated into like 19 languages. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: Wow!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: They wrote this article! I did a shop drop in 2009, at IKEA in Emeryville. Shop dropping is when you place your artwork in a commercial environment, often a store. And I shop dropped on Black Friday, 2009, to speak about excessive consumerism, American culture, yet of course, Swedish culture has consumerism, excessive consumerism in it as well, and I'm half Swedish. So I decided to do it at IKEA, felt symbolic. I took my daughter, in her stroller, and used her as a decoy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: Yep yep, nobody's a threat with a stroller [laughter]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: And packaged the pieces in the same size and format as their posters. And walked on in with 10 of them, into IKEA. And they thought they were returns when I came in with them under my arm and they directed me to the returns and I said, 'Oh, I'm just gonna walk through a little bit and I'll go there,' and then I went and placed them and documented them all, it's on my website. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I also had contacted press beforehand, the Oakland Tribune, which still existed at that time. So they contacted IKEA for a statement. Their national spokesperson denied that it happened because they didn't know, they hadn't seen it. I suppose they didn't say they were opposed to it but they just made a very formal, 'We did not, we are not behind this project.' But then they came around and I thought this was a really nice full circle, is that they then wrote this article in their employee magazine that gets translated into I think 19 languages and sent to all their IKEA employees all over the world, about this project. And respectfully wrote about it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: Love it!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: <i>And finally, it’s time to find our makeshift recording studio.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: We can try the bathroom. Bathrooms are often so echoey because of all the tile.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">[accordion music] </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: Right [laughter]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: Oh yeah, we should, we should check out up there. ... Oh, that could be interesting. [footsteps on wooden stairs] Like enclosed, cozy, lots of textiles...Maybe we can try up there. [door creaking]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: [echoing] Well maybe someone is, no, this is really </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: Ah, it's echoey </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: A little adventure!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: Little did you know, that's an echoey studio. Now you will always know. ...Oh this looks good. [laughter]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">BS: Welcome to your lair!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: Yeah no, this is perfect! </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: <i>We settle in a cardboard darkroom.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">[music]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: My first experience with true activism was in the 7th grade. And this was absolutely inspired by my father. I was going to Martin Luther King Junior High, in Berkeley, and noticed that the boys didn't have to wear a uniform for PE and the girls did. And I told my father about this. And obviously that's not right. Either both girls and boys wear uniforms, or neither. So he and I decided to try to change that. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He wrote the letter, I have to say. But it was from us, to the principle. And of course, one is not allowed to have sexism in any educational environments. And we received a letter back responding that they would change it. And I didn't realize at the time how empowering that was for me. There's things you can do. And you have to learn, you have to know that you can do them. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And I have to include here, being white, I mean, I am coming from a privileged background in learning these things from an early age and I acknowledge that this is something that is really important that we share with everyone that we absolutely can, everyone can—and I think people are learning that. People are feeling a lot more of that these days.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I grew up in Berkeley, between Berkeley, California, and Sweden. Grew up in a very political family. My father was a professor at U.C. Berkeley in cultural geography. Many discussions just around the dinner table. And even throughout the day. In the environments of the culture during that time. That was a time actually of the Vietnam war demonstrations. And also freedom of speech. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I mean there was a lot happening in Berkeley during that time and there was a lot of discussion, I was made very aware of it because it was sort of part of the interaction I had. Particularly with my father. And then spending time in Sweden, of course with the socialist government there and the very different attitudes toward life and rights as simple as free education and free healthcare being the norm over there. So these ideas are deeply grounded in me as being how life should be, you know, basic human rights, healthcare and education.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: And your mom was Swedish?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: Yes. My mom was, they called it back in the day, a stewardess for PanAm. And PanAm hired a group of Swedish stewardesses that they wanted to have. And even though my father was the most outspoken feminist of the two, of my mom and dad, my mom just sort of embodied feminism in her behaviour. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Coming from a really poor background in Sweden, and fighting really hard to get out there in the world, which is how she ended up becoming a stewardess and wanting to see the world. She actually was too short, they had very strict requirements, weight, height, you were ideally supposed to be blonde, she was not, you know the sort of stereotypical blonde woman. But she really outperformed herself even though she wasn't the correct height and was hired. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: How did she do that?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: She was a very strong person. And with a strong personality and she obviously persisted and I, I get that from her. Persisting is not a bad thing. I mean, there's a time and place for it but certainly for women's rights, equal rights, human rights, gun reform, there are a lot of issues right now that we need to be really persistent with. So persistence is really part of who I am, it's really really in my blood. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To create work that can hopefully empower, or inspire and create change in the world, you know? Basic human rights is a key issue for me, social justice is a key issue for me, they go hand in hand. And so it's work that I feel I need to do, I feel like it's my responsibility. What is important to me in life? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What my role, in my life, is to do, is to create work that hopefully inspires change, dialogue, thought, um, someone recently referred to my purses as a sort of call and response and I really liked that analogy. Of the purses. And in fact, she's someone who I've never met, I know through Instagram who lives in Sweden, she']s from America. And she said it's inspired her to write, about her own ideas of feminism. But the work, seeing the work, she just mentioned this on Instagram to me. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SV: Oh!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MP: Yes! And that's what I want! That's what I want, to stimulate ideas. And ignite conversations. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">[musical interlude]</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">SV: And at what point did you decide to become an artist?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">MP: I studied photography in high school and I'm not sure what I wanted to do. I had all these ideas and I felt like being creative was the best way I could express them, I'm not a writer, I couldn't be a teacher or professor I thought—which, much later I became an adjunct professor at California College of the Arts (CCA). But I started with photography at CCA and it just morphed into a lot of things. <br></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I did an individualised major at CCA and I just started incorporating assemblage and different materials. But that's also when I started working with text and different materials, is when those ideas were really born, especially with the feminist work. So that's where some of that came from.<br></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">SV: So let's talk about purses. What do purses mean to you?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">MP: Purses... [sigh] in some ways mean a woman's body. Some of the first purses from the "Power of the Purse" series that I've been doing now for a few years, said 'My body, my business,' that's a text I came up with several years ago. And other people had used it in other formats, in the body building world and, but now it's being used a lot more as sort of a feminist tag line. But they actually represent me, myself. And women. They're obviously something probably most women carry in different formats. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But the first purse collage I did—I've been doing these for a long long time—I filled one of them with a whole lot of barbed wire and cut what was sort of like a window, and put a piece of glass. So you could look into the purse and see the barbed wire. And that represented what was inside of me: a lot of pain. And so I've done collages with purses for years. They, to me, represent maybe a lot of hidden things, what you have inside of your purse, you don't necessarily always wanna share that with other people, it's very personal. And so to me they represent, you know, what's inside of us. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But also then taking these ideas and putting them on the outside. To me the purses that I'm working on now, the "Power of the Purse" series are like small scale mobile political billboards that you can walk around with. So, and spread a message, and inspire or ignite conversation or laughter or anger or many different things.<br></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">SV: In Freudian symbolism, the purse is supposed to be the vagina. This is what he thought, because he thought purses, you know, you put things in you take them out, which of course is a very male idea of what a vagina might be—<br></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">MP: [laughing] Yeah, I'd forgotten about that.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">SV: But it's true that purses are coded as female, <br></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">MP: Very<br></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">SV: Very heavily coded as female and in fact that if you don't have a purse, you're kind of rogue, you're a rogue character.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">MP: Right right right <br></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">SV: You're using pockets!<br></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">MP: I also just think they're beautiful in themselves. I collect these vintage purses and each one is so unique and they have a story, they've all been carried by someone. They've maybe been sitting in a closet a lot but they were part of someone's life and then now they're having a second life. And that's really interesting to me as well. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I actually, when I started making purses again (I hadn't for a long time), this was back in 2011, I started making birth control purses so they actually, and that was also about what's on the inside, what they would carry, and that's also about reproductive rights and access to birth control. So I started collaging hundreds and thousands of birth control pills on purses. And again that was about making a statement on the outside, something that we normally carry inside of our purse. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And then I started making some neon pieces. With actual neon. And on vintage train cases, the round cases, often American Tourister bags. I loved the symbolism of them as well. And that refers to traveling too, like being on an airplane, and I grew up traveling a lot, my mom the stewardess...So it hearkens back, yeah to a  lot of different ideas. So I made several of these and I'm still making them. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And then what happened in 2013, I was gonna go to the Armoury fair in New York. And I had been making some of these, actual neon purses. And I'd learned about luminescent wire. And all you need is a battery. It doesn't have to be plugged into a wall. The big neon pieces are stationary. You can't walk around with them. And I thought, 'I wanna make one that I can wear. And it's gonna be about reproductive rights. It's gonna be about pro-choice.' And literally the day before I was flying out, I made a purse that said 'choice' on it. </span></p>

<div class="gmail_default">The patriarchy, that's what.</div>
<div class="gmail_default"><br>Welcome to the cool, stone-walled studio of avant garde Stockholm jewellery designer Helena Johansson Lindell. We fall in love with her capacity to turn plastic toy bits (don't you have a box of plastic toy bits??) into smooth, multilayered wearable art. She's that genius who can look at a Lion King franchise Happy Meal toy and see the perfect oval pendant hiding within its soul. Svea's four-year-old daughter appreciates all aspects of this experience. Colours are discussed. Also, <em>kardemummabulle</em>!</div>

<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Svea Vikander</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: Evla Boyda-Vikander</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Helena Johansson Lindell</span></p>
<p class="p2">__</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Voiceovers in italics.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: <i>Helena Johansson Lindell is a jeweller I met when she had a show at Velvet Da Vinci, the now-closed fine art and jewellery gallery on Polk Street in San Francisco. When I was in Sweden with my family this summer, I got in touch with Helena.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yeah, no. Did you want milk in your coffee?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Yes, yeah.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: <i>and she agreed to show me her studio and talk about her practice. I brought my four-year-old daughter with me because she’s an artist, too.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: Do you know what I? My second-favourite colour is light green.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Mm, that's also nice colour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: <i>Helena was very kind to come in and meet us in her studio. It was the holidays, and despite the fact that she shares the one large workroom with three or four other people, there was no one else there. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Do you, do you work here alone?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: No, it's not just mine [laughter]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: So it's like a communal space? Do you live here? How does this work?!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Eight people are here now, or nine actually, but then most, most of us have holiday now. So very few are here working.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Except for you</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Well I'm not really here.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Oh, no?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: No. I came here to meet with you!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Oh, ok! [laughter]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV:<i> It was a sunny day in Stockholm. Her studio is in Södermalm, which is an artsy part of town with small businesses, immigrants, excellent thrift stores with none of the dirt and cat hair you find in American thrift stores, and consignment shops that sell vintage children’s shoes for almost nothing. Paradise, basically.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: I'm wearing really pretty shoes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Oh, would you like to show Helena your new shoes? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Oh please do</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Yeah we just got these at the consignment store. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Ooh. They are nice. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: They're, they're high-heeled.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: They're high heels?!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: Yeah, they're kind of like they're high heels, because they have kind of have a bump, like high heels</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yeah they are very nice...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: <i>To get to Helena’s studio, you have to call her from the buzzer. She lets you in and you walk through a vestibule to get to a large inner courtyard. Helena’s studio is on the ground floor of the large building across the courtyard and has few windows. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Please have some kanel, or kardemummabulle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Oh my goodness, what's that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Cardamom...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: It's cardamom and it's cinnamon! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL Yeah maybe a little cinnamon but mostly cardamom, I think.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: [through mouth full] Oh my god, it's so good!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>We first sit down in the (very clean) communal kitchen</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: I'm gonna have a sip of your juice, hon</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: K</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Oh wow, how tasty! Did you say 'thank you'?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: Thank you</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>and talk fashion and colours.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: I also have a caftan. Mama has two.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: OK, mmm</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: And you have one, one the same pattern I do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yeah colours are important, I agree. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: I like any colour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Any colour?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: Mmmhmm. But I hate black. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Why?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: It interrupts my colours. Like interrupts them and makes them into grey. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yeah</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Are you talking about mixing? With the painting?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: Yeah</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Yeah, black is so, very bossy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yes!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Cuz you know you just add a little bit and it takes over the whole thing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Exactly. Is that something you, do you call it a bossy colour, or is that a saying? Cuz I've never heard that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: It's just me</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Because I never heard that but it's so good. It is a bossy colour! [laughter]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: It's true! It is a bossy colour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: You know, um, red and white make pink</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Mmm exactly, I think blue is my least favourite favourite colour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: And also mine. And also purple. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Ok yeah, purple has a lot of blue in it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: And magenta is pink and red is pink and pink is red.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Say that again so I can follow you. Magenta is...pink</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: pink</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: And then red is pink too?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: Yeah, and pink is red.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yeah exactly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Did you think you would be discussing colour theory with a four-year-old?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: No but I think this is very interesting, I'm very happy that we're having this conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[music]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: So what have you been up to?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: I'm thinking I'm at more of a breaking point or, I need to take a bigger step. But let's see in which direction or how big. [laughter] I don't know!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: How do you know you're at a breaking point? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Like I've outgrown the space. I have so many materials and so many things. And then, the pieces grow also. They started growing when I moved here but now I need a space where they can grow even bigger.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: OK. Shall we go take a look at some of Helena's work? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: Yeah</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: OK, can you show us some..?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Sure</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[sounds of getting up]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Can we leave our bags here?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yeh</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Oooh ooh! This is the one I always see pictures of, on Instagram</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: I like your things up there! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yeah</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: <i>So, if you haven't picked up on this yet: my kid had never been to an artist interview before (she’s now been to three or four) but at the time she was very, very excited. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[rustling sounds]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Do you have beads like that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Do we have beads like that? Not quite the same, but some other beads.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: Hey! What are these?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Having a great time fondling all the beads, knick-knacks, hooks, handles, pieces of plastic that Helena uses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Well I'm not sure, it's not done yet</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: It's interesting because like, these materials are also her materials, right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yes</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Don't you remember being a kid in going into some art space and it just totally imprinting on you?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>There’s something nice about sharing a space with so many different people—</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, what, what are these machines here?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>they share their tools, so the tools used for woodworking or metalworking </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: For, this can cut metal and yeah, wood and plastic</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Where is the blade? Oh there, ok yeah</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yeah here</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>are relevant to Helena’s work with plastics.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: This was a gift to Elsa, from her boyfriend. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Really? [giggling]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: And uh, I'm the one who's been using it mostly. I'm very grateful, yeah. And then this is the grinding machine for wood and plastic. Some metal too, but mostly this we use for metal, for silver things, for example. I don't use it but yeah, the other three use it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: It's like a polishing? Yeah</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: And we have an acid bath, also for metals and then also like a polishing machine, and ultrasound for cleaning...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: And also there's a small thing that you can play with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Oh you mean the guitar?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: Yeah</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Or banjo, maybe?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: But it looks just like a small guitar. It doesn't even look like a banjo.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Her section of the studio…</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Do you have beads like them? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>…is a corner crammed full of stuff. Helena has a poster in her studio, that says "sökis" </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yeah exactly, </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: It says...hard plastic</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Looking for plastic</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Which means, in essence, 'give me all your random plastic crap.'</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: ...for ongoing art projects. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Right</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: And then it's my email, and a website.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: And do you get donations from people?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Plastic isn’t normally magnetic but if you’ve had kids you know that they attract it. Helena can use this plastic to make minimalist, clean-lined, carefully proportioned sculptures. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>And believe me, my kiddo LOVES Helena’s artwork.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[polka music]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: I like your things up there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yeah, which one?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: all of them. I like these things in here. I like these things in bags and also not in bags. I also like it, I also like it. I like these, I like um those silly pencils. Yeah. I like your stuff. I like those, um uh, those um uh, clear things. I like the pink most. Hey, also there is a heart bracelet! Hearts are the best! I like this, I like this, I like all of these beads on here. I like those.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yeah, I thought you might. But the thing is, I think you should have it. That's your favourite colour and it's also your size. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: I also, I also like it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[polka music stops abruptly]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Maybe you guys could work on something together. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Exactly</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: A little collaboration</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yes, she would give me ideas, I'm sure. She already has.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[polka music fades in]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Helena’s feeling a shift in her work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Maybe bigger, maybe furniture-sized </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Yeah? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: But still very relating to the body anyway</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Like in relationship to the body, yeah</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>And if she has a bigger space, she can get more stuff. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yeah so fingers crossed I'll find something pretty soon. I have to give three months.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Three months? Is that standard for Sweden? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Three months is quite a lot, actually. But if I find someone who can move in earlier then, but it would be an empty corner. Because the furniture is mine and like everything is...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Uh huh. yeah you would take it all with you right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Mmhmmm</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: The other places you're looking at, like are they woodworking studios? Do they have large--</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yeah I'm looking for that as well, so I can work with wood. and I'm even thinking of taking an evening class to do woodworking techniques</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Ooh that would be exciting, yeah!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yeah, I don't need to decide</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Jewellery, sculpture, why differentiate between the two? That's just the patriarchy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Thank you. [laughter] That's a good way to end.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: "*bleep* the patriarchy. The End." [giggling] I now conclude my studio visit! We should probably get going now, huh?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: No, no</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: I know, it's so fun </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: Are we ever gonna see her again?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Are we ever gonna see Helena again? I have the feeling that we will </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: Yeah, I hope so</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: And maybe she'll have a new studio. OK, shall we head out? Let's say thank you also for our new jewellery</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: Thank you a-Thank you!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HJL: You're welcome! So nice to have you here. Hej då!</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: I'm just gonna say my reflections. Helena seems super happy and healthy and uh, she's on summer vacation but she came in just for us. And she needs a new and bigger studio. So I hope the next time we see her she has a new and bigger studio.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EB-V: But um, can I, can I [microphone moves closer to her] What I like about her is because her has so much pretty things and also pink things and also that her has so many necklaces and beads. And I also like that her has so much art. And all those things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: OK. Great, thanks!</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">jb - Jozefien Buydens</span></p>

<p class="p3"><em><span class="s1">music</span></em></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> So, we took the BART and we got off at Powell Station and walked up the Tenderloin to get to rsf, which is Kat’s studio and gallery. And although I had the address we walked right past it and we had to turn around and I was embarrassed, but Jozefien was very forgiving.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> So, Kat opened the door and they were wearing this black shirt with pizza slices. And, they were also wearing this ceramic necklace with a pizza slice piece on it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> So, we have one back office and then four studios. Two… </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Yeah, we enter this not so big gallery space, which is full of light.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> …another artist just moved in next, so this kind of this shift happened recently</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> So, we got a tour of the gallery right when we walked in, so. The gallery is pretty small, but also functions studio space.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Excellent! Very beautiful bathroom, very artistic bathroom.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> I went to the bathroom. The bathroom was really nicely decorated, there where like these white tiles and this black cement in between them. Then there were, I remember gold, golden objects, there were newspapers next to the toilet so you could read if you wanted to and I also remember this pinkish-reddish light, so, it was kind of an LA feeling I got there or a very artistic, very very modern, a little bit alienating.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> I mean, I love this whole vision of the gallery from up here. It's a pretty dynamic space the way it’s been set up and so it's kind of it's a really fun space to work with. This is actually me and my friend Caitlin in undergrad…</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> That’s awesome! </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> …from back in the day.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> and we conducted the interview in Kat’s studio, which she shares with another artist named Kaitlin. They've been friends for 7 years. They provided like drinks and there were snacks for us, so, that was really cool, so we could snack. And maybe I should mention that Kat was wearing an eyepatch and it looked great! Excellent ART CRUSH action there.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> my eye was hurting and then it, and I was trying to fix it and then earlier I woke up and it was so swollen and this was morning and it's like super swollen and I was, like, whatever I'm just going to deal with it later, but as I go on with the day I'm going to wear an eyepatch. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">[</span><span class="s1">laughing]</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> They also had a sparkling gem on one of their front teeth.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> I, like, got this gem thing put on… I'll just have all kinds of weird shit so …</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> How did you get that on?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> That’s really cool! </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> It was glued on with, what's it called, like, the way they put your braces, it’s just a glue.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> You can take it off again?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> Yeah, or I one day eat it, it just falls off and I eat it, after a couple of years or something. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Wait, this stays on for years?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> Yeah. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> I kind of want one!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> It’s great, everyone should do it! I always wanted a gold tooth, but it seemed weird to get a gold tooth if I didn’t need it and then I also liked grills, but that seemed inappropriate, and so, I settled on the tooth gem. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Svea asks Kat if they live here in the Tenderloin.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> I, no, I used to, for like four years, though, the other time I've lived here. I live in the Richmond now. It’s my first time I've lived in like a proper place, since I moved here.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Where were you living?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> The first place I lived I was on, I had a bunk bed, on the top bunk, with two other women with the guy in the room next to us, like, in this really small basement garage room place. We kind of had one window and it was like under a family in the outermost Sunset, in sort of an alleyway with a shitty bar. There was like rats in our walls, but I paid $300 dollars. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And, that was the first place, so, I just drove up here with $400, that’s how I moved here, so, that worked out pretty well. I had a studio, at a place called Earth Explosion the mission. I have always been really obsessed with getting a studio, even if I couldn’t afford it. I am very messy, I don't want to put it away and I don't like living with that stuff either. So, for, this works pretty well because I can do stuff with the gallery and come to my studio and do things here. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bigger is always better, but I mean I'm in the middle of downtown San Francisco, so it's pretty good. And, I do a lot of off-site work these days, I have been like doing clay stuff somewhere else, I've been doing wood things at work ‘cause we have a wood shop which I can use, it’s *** incredible. So, this is kind of, more like a thinking-assembling place anyway.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> I told Kat their studio is very neat and organised. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> I just moved in here two weeks ago.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Oh, you just moved in here! Okay, allright.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> I did. I’ve been trying to get rid of shit</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> The truth comes out. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">[</span><span class="s1">laughing]</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Yeah, actually I had questions about all your collaborations. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> Okay.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Like, Art Modes?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> Moms.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Moms.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> That’s the thing, so, the two women I run this gallery with…</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Kat runs the gallery with two women, Lauren Licata and Anicka Vrana-Godwin. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> We’ve had had a lot of project proposal we’re trying to put out. We’ve done things that’s not just the gallery, but there's some form of like institutional experimentation or curatorial experimentation. And, we haven't had as much time to put into it lately as we wanted to because of just running the gallery by itself, but that is like a thing we want to call… We wanted to figure out a name and everyone calls us art mom, because we're just moming people, I guess, and the art world in general. And then, we like bought a minivan to move a bunch of art and then it got really out of control. I’m the dad of the moms, though. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> And then of course there's the space we’re in right now, rsf, it's spelled r / s f. I'm not even sure how you’re supposed to pronounce that. Do you say r slash s f? Or do you just say r s f?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> No, we just say r s f. But, some people say R SF, they’re getting really sassy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> … r slash, r slash s f… </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> I mean, it’s like the slash denotes that SF is a place, but, at this point, it's a confusing name and we’re just going with it, so. We recently found out it also stands for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>‘rentable square feet’, which is really ironic. What to name a gallery? It's kind of hard. You just want to be cool and then you fail at it and it's fine and then you're just cool and elusive, because no one knows what it means, just like, we have no sign because we haven't been able to afford one and apparently people think it's a cool thing, so.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">[</span><span class="s1">music]</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> So, this place used to be the Larkin Street Youth Center and then it was a chiropractor and then it was nothing and then it was ours. But, it's part of being in the Tenderloin, it’s just like dealing with a lot of different kinds of people. No horror stories yet, some interesting ones, but…</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> What’s the most interesting so far? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> We had a couple of people really on drugs come in and, like, not want to leave because they’re really confused, and so, it’s just kind of, like, being able to escort them out. There is a woman who came in one time and was just like: “It's really bright in here!” We’re like: “Yeah, totally”, she’s like: “Does art really need this much light?”, and I was like: “I don’t know, that’s a good question”. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So, a lot of things you would never think to ask. We are next to Mr. Holmes bake shop, so people, when it closes down come over and ask us if we’re a bake shop and then ask us over and over again if they are really closed, because people are obsessed with that bake shop.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Why?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> Just how, they have really good neon signs, "I got baked in San Francisco,” super lightweight, very chill, I mean, it’s good food, but it's just like a very intense hype situation. They’ll literally take an Uber to Mr. Holmes, get out, look at it and it's closed and then they'll be like: “Well, I guess I'll just take a picture of the facade”, and then they'll call another Uber and then leave. I like this area there's some cool bars. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So, this place, we got it, it was completely, like, it was like nothing, they’ve had just torn up all of the carpet, it was like a total *** show. That whole front area where it's two stories and you can see, that wasn’t like that, we had them knock out a ton of stuff, like the floor and walls and rooms. We got into a situation where we needed so much renovation we were able to negotiate. They did with what we asked them to do, and then we did 10 days of renovation, and it was so insane.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It was, like, every day all day long, sleeping like 4 hours a night, for like a week and I was working full-time and we were sanding the floors and then, like, install the toilet and the sink and everything. I've never done any of that *** before. We had a paint sprayer and scaffolding and painting everything, so, it was us three girls doing the whole place ourselves, did all the baseboards and everything. And, we had some help too, of course, thank God, but we got it done in 10 days while planning an exhibition.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> They, they do so many things.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> And, don't forget they have a full-time job driving a forklift for SFMOMA, where they’re a preparator and get to touch a lot of expensive art. They’re busy. There's also this thing they do, called Drunk Barber. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> It’s good! I cut hair</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> You cut hair?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Which is this kind of Darren O'Donnell type relational aesthetics thing and we probably wouldn't even have heard about it if we hadn't asked about the braid of hair hanging on their studio wall. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> One of my guy friends was like: “I need to cut my hair, but, I can’t afford to pay a guy”, so, I was like: “Sure, bring me some beer and I'll cut your hair”. And then, I would cut his hair and then we get drunk and I'll be cutting his hair. And then, his friends would also need haircuts, so, I cut their hair. So, now I cut anywhere from like 5 to 10 people's hair.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">[</span><span class="s1">music]</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> Do you wanna hear about the Dead Alleys? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Yes! Go for it. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> I just dress up really crazy. I like to wear really tall shoes, some extremely tall, and pretty scantily clad and I don't wear my glasses, so, I can't see anyone's faces and I can look at people, like, really dead on for extended periods of time which is really uncomfortable, and I get very much in their face and their space and I act, like, really sassy and annoyed, and I eventually end up rolling around on the floor, like, kicking stuff, while screaming, it's like super cathartic, kind of, like, performance. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I took a class at SFAI and this girl comes up to me and I just met her, she's like: “Hey, I have this idea. Do you want to be in a band?”, I was like: “Yes! I've always wanted to be in a band”, I literally want to be the frontman of the band for I don't know how many years, I can never find anyone to play with me, and I even wrote a piece about it when I was an undergrad where I'm playing guitar on a video and singing live—except I’m in a band by myself, that’s how much I wanted to be in a band, so. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">She was like, you got to be the frontman. So, she's from Colombia and the whole idea, the premise around this band was that she was listening to punk music, she was in the punk scene, hardcore in Columbia when she was younger and didn't really realise what all these like English lyrics were or like how, like, what the context of them was. So, she kind of resented this like colonialising that had happened through music to her directly, because she listened to songs being like: “This is really *** up,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can't believe I was like dancing to this *** or whatever”, and, she wanted to reverse it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So I operated as an American vessel kind of like, or the singer, and we listen to songs in languages we don't understand, so there's like four languages we can't even touch between the two of us, I phonetically transcribe the lyrics and she does it to the music. So, I listen and then I just type them out, like, new gibberish sounds. And, we just pick songs we think are good, for what they sound like. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But, it's really hard to find stuff when you can't type in other languages on Google, so, you're like, Indonesian bands and you find every Indonesian band that sings in English. So, finding these songs has been a huge labor of love and then we put together a set of like 15, 20 maybe sometimes 30 minutes. We've been performing for like 3 years doing that band. And then she had to move back to Colombia ‘cause she had visa problems. But, we are trying to put something together during Material Art Fair in Mexico in February. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There's a huge punkrock scene where I grew up, a lot of people and stuff like that too, like, in bunkers and desert, punkrock shows, all that kind of ***. All of my work comes from my hometown. It is a very weird place. My dad moved there to realise the American dream, as an immigrant basically. It was cheap to buy a house there in the 80s and it was going to be this burgeoning area outside of LA, which in many ways it grew exponentially, but it didn't grow in the way that like, a town does where you, like, know people and there's like a good sense of community.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It just grew literally in numbers and people commute like 2 hours to LA from there, on a regular basis, every day. LA was doing a lot where they're trying to build Section 8 housing and like, push gang members and other people out of LA that they didn't want in LA and there’s also a lot of meth, tons of meth. But, outside of those things, when I was child it was fun being there, like, in the middle of the desert.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I rode motorcycles and horses and just walk through the desert for hours and we had a little bit of snow and grew up next to a peach orchard, just really cool, and then right after I left they demo’ed the whole farm, ‘cause they can't afford to keep a farm going anywhere, it’s too expensive and they were going to put houses and then the 2008 housing market crash happened. I feel like that area is very much about missed opportunity or like unfulfilled potential and that is something I think about a lot in my work. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Access to food and food deserts and, like, what it does to people when they just don't have access to the things they need, as a body, that's not Walmart. There's more people employed by Walmart in my hometown than the school districts, that's a form of incarceration.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">[</span><span class="s1">music]</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> I was a very mellow teenage, like, I didn't do any drugs or drink or anything, so I had a lot of free time to kill, which was good, I learned a lot of things. But I also, like, we just go to Walmart at 11 o’clock at night with my friends and fuck around there, because it was the only thing open in my whole town. So, it’s like games where you take an apple and put it in the banana section then you take a B thing and put it in the C section, and then you take a C thing and put it in the D section, and then you have to go back around to replace them again. The people who a loading up at 2 a.m., they don’t give any fucks</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> does somebody else comes along and put it back?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> Yeah. You have to guess, backwards, yeah. It’s a good game! It eats up some time, but the desert in general is a weird place. I feel always strange about people who hyper-fetishise the desert as this, like, reawakening or whatever.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’m, like, the desert’s a place where people are not supposed to live, there’s no water, everyone complains about growing farms and having no water and I'm like: “Why did you put a farm there? It's a desert”. So, there's like all these identity crises, like, of what land is supposed to do for us and, like, how we are entitled to a land or space and it should function this way that serve the human, you know. We're always trying to, like, pretend boundaries don’t exist when they do. So, it's a pretty funny place.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">[</span><span class="s1">music]</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> I think about my parents a lot in my art. It’s like a lot of this idea of the American Dream or, like, what we're supposed to be or become or what we're supposed to do, and like all of these boundaries that contain us and how people have chosen to acquiesce to these designations, and it's eventually cause them to be extremely miserable. Or to kind of fail very dramatically in ways that they could never have even understood. So, I'm always kind of, I'm very pro trying to dig out and understand who you actually are and allowing yourself the ability to, like, transform and change constantly in order to just like be *** happy. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And, I watch my parents, like, try to be someone for someone else, for their mothers or the things had to be certain ways and it just blew up in their faces. And, you know, so, I think a lot about how to not be my own worst enemy. That’s what all this house stuff is, like, domesticity and a white picket fence and, like, I've become really obsessed with ants lately.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> They mean ants, the little brown, black insects, not your father's sister.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> They were in my work, like, really small, like drawn all over stuff, they were one of my bad guys. I have three three bad guys in my narrative: the ants, the mould and the power outlets are the bad guys. So, they’re anything that comes from the outside in and disturb, like, the peace or the safety of household consumption. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ants always get in, it's like, you can do whatever you want to try and block them out, you can build more walls, better systems or put drugs down whatever, they still get in. So, they’re always, like, they're my resistance basically. They’re kind of an existential creature, which I didn't fully understand until I became like hyper obsessed with them recently. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And then, mould is a bad guy, because it rots things. So, it like reveals to your own mortality and comes in and interrupts your process, things that are fresh and have these, like, time frames on them and we don’t, we don't like being restrained by time and also, I had an experience in high school where black mould grew in my room and gave me asthma for, like, a number of years, like, ruined my whole athletic career, basically, yeah.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> That’s horrible.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> It's ‘cause I lived in a shitty apartment, you know. It’s like you, you don't have money, you get sick, and then…the outlets are not so much bad guys, I call them soothsayers. Like, there's an action of connecting something that comes from the outside to the inside that you're like reliant, dependent on, like, electrical umbilical cord, you know, and if you look at them they look and horrified, all the time. To me they're like the things that are telling you that there's something up, but no one listens, you know. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">[</span><span class="s1">music]</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> My work is basically primarily all about space and I was realising recently how much that has evolved in such a weird different ways. There’s certain things that I’ve parsed out through conversation with people about ways that I experience things differently. I don't even know what the word is, but like, every time someone says any words when there's any descriptors in it I imagine the thing playing out in my brain constantly as I’m talking to people. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So, it’s like, if someone is talking about a dragon fly, I could see a dragon and then a fly, but it's like, constant visualisations that are always happening in my brain and I also have, like, I have bad I eye sight. My ability to, like, navigate space is pretty weird, I have had to learn how to really focus if for some reason, like, using power tools and stuff, like, I have to really pay attention. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I think, I have this thing of where my, my sense of where body starts is more amorphous or, like, I feel very physically connected to people wanting things around me all the time and it's always kind of inside of my personal space. I have had to roll through a lot of punches, so, I take things pretty well. I actually do like a wounded animal thing where I, like, will be fine and then I just go away for, like, a couple days and talk to nobody and, like, go lick my wounds by myself and then I'll come back out later. I get really moody. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> What do you do in that time?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> I just ruminate in my sadness. I like just being in bed, looking at plants. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Plants?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> Yeah, I have plants. Just, like, staring out the window and it’s even better when it's foggy or rainy. Look at Instagram fo far too long. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">[</span><span class="s1">music]</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>kt:</strong> January, speaking of transformative bodies, there's this artist, Maria Guzman Capron, she makes these like amazing quilted female figures that are turning into or out, coming out of landscapes and stuff, and they’re like tons of found fabrics that she paints or alters a little bit and they’re quilted together and they're oftentimes relating to, like, what does it mean to be a woman body that ages or is an immigrant or is non white or, like, has a difference to it and how is that body kind of always shifting and changing and how does it become re-empowered. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So, there’s all these kind of crazy creature-esque women who are sometimes like half animal or landscape and they have these, like, a leg that's turning into a waterfall. It's kind of, kind of crazy to try to imagine it but, it's all quilted and then she'll do a lot of sculptural pieces too with, like, found objects or even ceramics that look like found objects, so she made them and they almost like reference *** she’s seen in a dream, sea shells or stuff like that. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So, she's doing her show here in January in conjunction with our booth at Untitled Art Fair and that booth has Maria in it as well as Marcela Pardo Ariza who's a previous show we just did and Tosha Stimage, who is at Grow Gallery right now. So, it's a queer, POC, fem booth, which I’m pretty stoked about. It’s gonna be really good. </span></p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p class="p2"><strong>Abbreviations</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SV: Svea Vikander</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">AB: Alban Bessuet</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">BF: Beth F.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">PH: Peter Halstead</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CF: Cathy Frank/Halstead</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CO: Chris O’Reilly</span></p>
<p class="p2">__</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[Dramatic piano music: “La Semaine Grasse”, performed by Jenny Chen]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>AB:</strong> ...Oh absolutely. And, I mean the intensity, the investment of soul and mind and ideas and energy that went into this project is, I mean it feels like giving birth. I had the exact same feeling of embracing humanity as when, um, we gave birth to my first daughter. It was the exact same feeling I had.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[piano crescendo, applause]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>SV:</strong> Most artists don't have much money and their work is small by necessity. It fits into storage lockers or on the walls of their buyers, to be sold at craft fairs. But every once in a while, an artist gets rich. Or people with a lot of money happen to be artists. When this happens, it's kind of amazing. Because when artists have money, they don't stop working, they don't retire early. They keep making their work. They just make it... Bigger.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That's what's happened at tippet rise. Tippet rise is an 11,000 acre sculpture park bordering millions of miles of parkland along the Beartooth mountain range of Montana. It's a non-profit but entirely privately funded; the people who run it are artists, designers, and musicians. They've got the kind of budget most arts workers can only dream of; and so they're doing big things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their centre opened in the summer of 2016. It contains monumental sculpture; work by Mark Disuvero, Alexander Calder, Dougherty, and others. It has an immense concert hall. It has a band shell. It has an artist residency building decorated in tasteful earth tones. It aims to join the ranks of storm king and the Chinati foundation, drawing visitors to experience looming, abstracted sculpture in a rugged natural landscape.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[car on gravel sounds]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[muffled dialogue] can I close this? Well, I dunno…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>SV:</strong> After camping overnight in Yellowstone National Park, my husband and I paid a visit to the bison, and drove highways and side roads to get to Tippet Rise, which is in the small ranching community of fishtail, in Montana.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[car driving sounds] [room ambience sounds]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[muffled dialogue] ...Your tour guide today... / hi, I'm svea, / very nice to meet you, welcome to Tippet Rise</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>SV:</strong> The first person we meet on our arrival is the center director, Alban Bessuet. I spent a few hours with Alban, as he drove me from one sculpture to another. With his warm, understated manner and french accent, he is the epitome of an art world stereotype. And yet, he's also a man of contradictions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He drives a beat-up pickup truck. He has two smart phones, one for international calls, but they are both falling apart. When I asked him about the possibility of a sculpture being defaced by graffiti on them, first, he gives me the official answer: that they're trying to educate the public, and each sculpture is monitored by a docent; but then he tells me the answer I didn't even realise I was fishing for. He tells me,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>AB:</strong> Well if it's a nice graffiti, maybe for the better! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[piano music, building in intensity]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>SV:</strong> And he takes me to see the sculptures – a spaceship-like wooden structure by Stephen Talasnik, a replica of a nearby one-room schoolhouse with whorls of vine structures growing inside it by Dougherty; and an immense metal piece by Mark Disuvero.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the most striking piece is by Ensamble Studios. A heretofore unknown Spanish design duo (a couple) made this piece. It's called Beartooth Portal. It's huge,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[abrupt music cut; large blowing wind sounds]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But seems small under the Montana sky. It's two massive slabs of poured concrete leaning against each other like two halves of a clam shell. Sheltering from the wind beneath them, Alban explained to me how they had made the sculpture.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>AB:</strong>…Poured concrete, and it captures the shape, shape of the land as a cast, as a print...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>SV:</strong> Imagine scooping out two wide holes in the sand of a flat beach and then lining those holes with plastic bags and pouring wet sand inside. If this were very good sand, or if you were a very good sandcastle builder, you could eventually pick up those two slabs after they had dried and perhaps even lean them against each other. Now imagine that they are made of concrete; now imagine that they're on a mountain top. And now imagine that they weigh—</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>AB:</strong> half a million pounds. Half a million pounds, that's a lot of weight. So we had to bring some of the biggest cranes in Montana to tilt the structure. It was very much like a bridge structure—</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>SV:</strong> But wait – did you catch that? The biggest cranes in Montana? A bridge-like engineering project in this small, unincorporated town of fewer than 500 people? What will the neighbours think?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are people who wouldn't want a Tippet Rise in their backyard. A branch of the project slated for Colorado had to be canceled after the neighbours voiced concern for environmental impact and noise. And here in Montana, one neighbour has promised to pick up a megaphone and sing that staple of town-hall meetings, Joni Mitchell's 'big yellow taxi' if she hears music from the concert hall, ever. The staff at tippet rise don't like to talk about this part, each one tells me that the neighbours have been surprisingly supportive.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I spoke with Beth F., a woman visiting the centre for the first time that day. And she says it's a bit of both.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>BF:</strong> So, there's, it's funny because as we were driving here my husband said, well there's the neighbours I guess that have an issue with all the trucks, who live on the route that the trucks all drove into and out of day after day as they were constructing the place and then there's the other set of neighbours who weren't impacted by any of that and so there's this huge positive side and not, I wouldn't call it negative, they were just impacted.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>SV:</strong> I used to live in the country and I can understand why people would be upset at having so much change brought into their lives. The people coming in to see Tippet Rise after all are not mostly from Montana; they're not ranchers. They don't know the land.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[mournful string music, uncomfortably long]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But one thing I noticed in my day at tippet rise was that the people working on the project in their own way do truly love the land.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>CF:</strong> Montana is just its own beauty that's more raw and more enormous and just, you, absolutely, you know,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>SV:</strong> That’s Cathy Frank.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>CF:</strong> you know, who could forget this land?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>SV:</strong> She and her husband Peter Halstead are the brains and the financing behind tippet rise. Both come from business and banking families; both are artists. They've been married for 36 years and they're the kind of couple who speaks in unison, who finish each other's sentences (though he finishes hers more than she finishes his) and when I ask them about this huge project, their newest art centre, they just want to talk about each other.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>CF:</strong> We really just thought about all the incredible moving experiences, these actually astonishing experiences [[interruption from Peter: that we had had]] yeah exactly, and we really tried to put them, you know, in some way all together.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>SV:</strong> I ask them to describe these magical experiences. Peter tells me two stories involving water – one, running through the sprinklers at Storm King in their 30s; and the other,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>PH:</strong> one day we were at the Venetian Theatre and it was raining and so the Polish pianist, Ivo Pogorelić said, 'Why doesn't everybody come on stage and listen to me play because otherwise you're gonna get wet', which was very nice and there were only like 50 people there, maybe 70, so we all went on stage and he played his concert and it was the most magical experience we've ever had and we said, what if we did that all the time? What if we mandated that? [[interruption from Cathy: not the rain! (laughter)]]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>CF:</strong> Well I have to say there were, probably there were many seeds, [[interruption from Peter: a birth]] exactly, and I, I was always in love with art and I always painted and I always drew and peter really always was in love with music and with writing [[interruption from Peter: and photography]]. And I always loved poetry and writing very much but really when we fell in love I fell in love with music. You know that came into my life and it became something that just added so tremendously to everything that I felt about the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>PH:</strong> And when we fell in love I said now I have to become a good poet. Now I have to be worthy of Cathy, I have to write something that is worthy of this incredible feeling we have. So it really was very helpful. I'm not saying it happened instantly but you know over the next 30 years progress was made. (laughter) not everyone would agree. (laughter)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>SV:</strong> So peter is a poet; and an enthusiastic one. He does a lot of the writing for Tippet Rise and in the program guide he describes music in this way</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Actor reading Peter’s poetry:…Essay or a spreadsheet. This is similar to the music of the spheres where the celestial frequencies flow through us to produce special effects. We are the transistors of the heavens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>SV:</strong> This is some pretty enthusiastic stuff for an art institution. Especially when the rest of the art world is saying things like this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bojana Kunst: Capitalism and the notion of production of subjectivity comes from a philosopher Maurizio Lazaratto, who actually put…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>SV:</strong> That’s Bojana Kunst, by the way. She's great, she's very smart. But I doubt she would have been as much fun to interview, at least not as much fun as Peter and Cathy. They're not into pushing your boundaries the way most of the art world wants to. They just want to make you feel ecstatic</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>PH:</strong> I went to school in New England and Cathy did too really and that's I guess the, the breeding ground of transcendentalism and Emmersonianism and Thoreau—Walden, Whitman, all of that and to me that kind of brisk morning, those variegated coloured hills struck me as the intellectual chrysalis of America and the values that I believe, values that we are in danger of losing in our country but the Northeast has closed down a bit it's not quite the open land that it was when I went to school and when we grew up there and so I think we were looking to find that same intellectual quality of open space somewhere else and so that's why why we looked to Montana because even Colorado the space we could see, so much space was going to developments and even though you could buy a ranch, even though you could buy a large ranch, in Colorado, you weren't entirely sure that the land around you wouldn't be a development in 10 years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[string music coming in]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whereas we found here the land was inexpensive enough and the way other people thought was similar to ours and nobody wanted to see a developments, they wanted to see the open plains, the open foothills, the big mountains, the big sky and so it was more simpatico with how we grew up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>CF:</strong> And the first time, you know, Peter got here first and he called me, he called me and he called me and he said I think you better come up here and seriously I came up and I could feel it in my cells</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[strings rise dramatically]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>SV:</strong> Chris O'Reilly is the music director at Tippet Rise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>CO:</strong> Peter and I studied with the same piano teacher, Russell Sherman in Boston many years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>SV:</strong> Chris is in charge of curating performances from musicians from all around the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[strings suddenly stop]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But he has also been doing a bit of the performing himself. He told me about a private concert he put on for the sculptor Mark Disuvero, who is in his eighties and has two pieces on the property.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>CO:</strong> We brought a very old steinway that I found in Santa Monica out and I played the final Shubert b-flat piano sonata for him and I understand there</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[raptor screech sound]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was a raptor of some sort careening in the background as I was playing for him, so in full gaze of the mountains and, apparently, the wildlife... It's unlike anything you could ever imagine I mean there really is no other place like this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[piano interlude]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>BF:</strong> …thinking how did I get here. It's David Byrne all over again, you know, how did I get this beautiful wife? What happened?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>SV:</strong> At the end of the day, I feel the same. I reunite with my husband. He has spent the day exploring the grounds by himself. He spotted a baby rattlesnake sunning itself and, six times, was offered a ride in one of the centre's solar-powered vans. He always prefers to walk.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We join a hundred other people for a concert by Konstantin Lifschitz, the most talented pianist I have ever heard; and then sit down for our tippet rise dinner, a locally-sourced and organic quail prepared by what may have been a cordon bleu chef and served on a disposable plate that's not made out of styrofoam but out of a pressed palm frond. As I drink my good white wine in the gentle shadow of a monochromatic, purposefully-rusted barn building, I do feel like I've entered some alternative, aesthete heaven.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But I don't feel relaxed. I felt both ecstatically happy and, well, a little unmoored.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[pause]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I feel tired. Cranky. It was all just too much. Too much art, too much music; too much beauty, too much kindness. It's a lot to handle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[short pause]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And apparently I'm not the only one.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>AB:</strong> it’s, it's a lot of emotion for one human being, it became very much overwhelming for all of us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[piano coda]</span></p>

How about being driven around by a sweet Frenchman who waxes poetic about his life’s work in a dusty pick-up truck? How about some gourmet locally-sourced food and a concert pianist? And some cows?

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">intro music</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb:</strong> Welcome ART CRUSH INTERNATIONAL. I’m Jozefien Buydens</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>sv:</strong> I’m Svea Vikander </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb:</strong> and together we take you into the studios of artists and you can find all sorts of fantastical things in art studios like paintings and drawings and sculptures and sometimes even a coffin… And on that note, Svea, who do we have a crush on today?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>sv:</strong> today we have a crush on Angela Hennessy. Angela, I don't even know how to put it into words to tell you this story of how we met a quite lovely young woman after one of Angela's talks at Southern Exposure for her show ‘When and Where I Enter’, and this woman was lovely, but she kept talking about how much she loves Angela, how amazing Angela was and how she really wanted Angela to be her mentor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was a former student of Angela's and she went to all of Angela’s events and it started to feel like a little bit, maybe this is a little bit stalker-ish or something, just maybe, you know, but it turns out that's actually an entirely appropriate response to meeting Angela Hennessy. You just become totally smitten, because she's just so eminently crush-worthy. She's a wonderful, wonderful person, she's very warm, she's very welcoming and she's a great artist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb:</strong> yes! So, Angela Hennessy is a multi-media artist and her studio is in West Oakland. The topics Angela works around our mourning, grieving, blackness and the work she makes are mostly made out of human hair. So, the works at Southern Exposure that we saw were made out of synthetic and human hair and they get like this very fragile look, delicate in a way, but also very powerful </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>sv:</strong> deep </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb:</strong> very deep and dark </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>sv:</strong> brilliant, it’s really incredible work</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">music</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> my name is Angela Hennessy and I am an Oakland-based interdisciplinary artist</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">music</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>sv:</strong> Jozefien picked me up and we drove to West Oakland, this is industrial Oakland but like most of Oakland it’s residential too </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll do my best not to take over this interview, okay?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb:</strong> no! you should ask questions, you ask very insightful questions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>sv:</strong> I know, but then it’s just me talking and that’s not the show, the show is not Svea interviewing people with the wonderful audience of Jozefien Buydens, that’s not the show</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb:</strong> well, I try to speak more. I tend to be…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>sv:</strong> just kick me, kick me under the table… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>sv:</strong> it's beautiful old houses beside beautiful old warehouses and the sounds of real work happening, real things being made, real things being shipped, real saws, real soldering irons, …</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb:</strong> I had to text her</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> hi</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb &amp; sv:</strong> hello, how’s it going? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> good to see you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb:</strong> it’s good to see you too</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> my space is upstairs</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb:</strong> Angela Hennessy’s studio is on the second floor of a small warehouse. It has a wall of south facing windows, brick walls, small bathroom, a sink and two large tables in the center, a rate with locks of hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">are they always on the table, your objects?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> yeah, i tend, this is kind of how i work. I have to say I did clean up for you guys, like it was literally just one heap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>sv:</strong> I was going to ask, are you always this organised? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> this does not look organised to me at all. i tend to make lots of parts and pieces of stuff and then, depending on a particular show or some particular theme, then I sort of gather everything, but I start with like a sort of library of objects and then piece it all together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm on the edge of outgrowing this space so, you know, I tend to, if I don't have things out in front of me where I can see them, then I can't keep track of them, so often what that means is that I have a lot of things out all over, but then what happens is, that gives me the opportunity when I have a specific object that I'm trying to make I have a lot of resources to turn to and to figure things out and I can always just imagine things in my head and so, I need to be able to see them side-by-side or push particular materials up against each other and actually have like a live in person experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My space is pretty full and it feels, sometimes I come in here and it's totally overwhelming, it's just so, you know, even though they're all of my own things I’m like: “Oh my god, somebody clean up in here!”, but then when I start working, you know, you get busy and you just, you get in a groove. As I get closer to a show or some kind of deadline I move things around, you know, so, I like actually just moved these tables back but I had pushed them out of the way so that I could lay the rainbow down on the floor in here, you know, and then the rainbow was done…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>sv:</strong> the actual rainbow piece is big: 15 feet wide, 8 ft tall, which is a sizable amount of crochet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> no</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>sv:</strong> and, she doesn't have any studio assistance</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> I crocheted every stitch of that thing myself</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">music</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> so, this is the main table that I work at, you know, if I'm crocheting or doing hair wrapping or making flowers, I'm at this table and then I tend to lay things out, sort of as a display or, you know, that I can see what I'm doing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb:</strong> it looks very cozy. It looks so welcoming and comfortable to see all these pieces laying on the table </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> I mean, I like that idea of it, maybe an aesthetic of coziness makes the work seem approachable in a particular way or perhaps accessible in a particular way but then I think too that it's important that the layers of maybe discomfort or, you know, sort of some of the tensions around the work in terms of racial identities in objects that are grieving becomes another layer to the cozy, right? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That it's all, it can all be there simultaneously and maybe sometimes as a collision, almost. And then I have, yeah, I don't know, lots of pins and sewing supplies, hair supplies, combs and brushes, things like that. I usually keep a bunch of hair to sort of hanging on the wall, so, I have the Ross Stock sort of experience what it looks like when you buy it at the store and then, I just put these two black panels up against the white wall so that I could have, you know, start thinking about my work against a black wall, which was a new aspect of the work at Southern Exposure, was having black painted walls as the background. And then over here, I guess this is like all my hardware…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb:</strong> she also has a table that's all shiny metal: golden chains, sheets of copper and a very special crochet hook. Is this the one for crocheting the rainbow, this one?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> yeah, this is my magic crochet hook, this is my favourite one. I have like 100 crochet hooks, but this is my favourite one</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb:</strong> and, it’s sparkly!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> yes, right, yeah I know. I think I'm really interested in the way that light interacts with materials and, you know, that was really like what brought me to this work, maybe in the very beginning in grad school, I was thinking about the interaction of light and so the working with the gold and working with this like glossy black enamel is very much for me, like, about, sort of calling in that visual experience that there's like a little flash of light or something that catches your eye. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My formal training is in metal work, metal is my first material making jewellery. These are mostly all just store-bought faux gold golden chains but I, you know, in school I learned how to make chain and I used to, I thought I was going to be a jewellery designer, actually, that was kind of the path I was going in my twenties. But, I think some of that sensibility, certainly for my relationship to materials, how I work with materials now, and the kind of scale that I work at, and sometimes the little details for the fuzzy things that I do, that totally comes out of my background as a jeweller. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>sv:</strong> And, that coffin?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> That, someone gave that to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>sv:</strong> someone saw that and thought: “Angela, Angela needs this in her studio”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> yes, that’s kind of exactly what happened. I haven’t quite figured out what to do with it, but it's just too amazing to not have. And, my son keeps on saying he wants to lay inside of it. It’s, it's actually intended to be horizontal, you know, like a coffin, so you could lay inside of the cage part</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>sv:</strong> You haven't let him yet?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> He hasn’t, we haven't done it yet, but maybe we will. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb:</strong> Angela structures her thoughts with mind maps …</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> I don’t know, maybe it's time for a new one</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb:</strong> There's an oversized piece of paper on the wall with visually arranged words and phrases of her thoughts and ideas </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> … just becomes this place, a gathering site, you know, where it's like, I can just have random thoughts and text and language and I get ideas for titles from my maps quite a bit and things that I read. I keep note cards in my purse, I'm always writing things down so it's just another kind of form of that.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">music</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>sv:</strong> Instead of an artistic practice she has an aesthetic practice </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> aesthetic as in a full sensory experience, a full range of experience, how I know things through my body, not just necessarily a visual experience. I’m trying to expand what that might mean. So, the hospice work and the doula work keeps me really grounded. Basically it’s, I think, if I were just talking about death and grief in the studio or in an academic environment it would be pretty easy to sort of go off in a very abstract kind of theoretical space. That, for me, is a very different way of being in the conversation, then the way that I feel when I’m, you know, sitting at the bedside of someone who is dying. It also keeps me, I think, in a fairly vulnerable space as well, you know, just understanding the precarity of being a human being.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, this idea of what textiles do for the body and with the body and the sensory experience of touch in the tactile, right, across all of that ties into death and dying and I'm really just, you know, even more broad than that, just being a human being, we basically begin our lives in textile structures or as textile structures. The umbilical cord and amniotic sac, we start that way and the first sensory experience that we have in the womb is touching, sound and it's also believed that touch and sound as well are the last senses to go when someone is dying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started doing a lot of research, as you do in grad school and when you have to write about your work, that really brought me into some historical grounding, looking primarily at European, specifically Victorian mourning practices, I am thinking about the role of cloth in the 1800s, that was kind of my entry point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I also recognised right away that this was a very white European Eurocentric practice, but looking at the hair jewellery specifically from that period and then thinking about hair as a material that in many cultures around the world is one of the materials that mediates the boundary between the living and the dead. I think you know some people maybe are more inclined to want to be present and engaged with difficult or complex topics and some people don’t, right, and so for me, I don't know how to not be, I mean, there is enough space for me to not be engaged in the politics of the black body, so. I find ways to bring, my own experience primarily, sometimes obviously thinking about the particular narrative about black female body is right now, so all of that kind of feeds into the work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me there isn't a space where I get to be free of that and so, I choose as an artist to go right into it. But, I think it's a different experience for people who are viewing the work and coming to it, from whatever's going on in their own lives and we are so saturated with images and information on a daily, you know, kind of constant basis and so sometimes there just isn't space till I can take on those complexities of, of identity and sexuality and danger or being, you know, with that black hole piece, like, I wanted it to pull people in but simultaneously push them away and, you know, in a particular way that, you know, is sort of a logical really, but you have to be an art viewer that is open to being moved by the work and not everybody is and that's okay.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">music</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb:</strong> Angela's connection to this works deep she's been crocheting since she was a child and hair and grieving are also deeply connected for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> My connection between hair and grieving came out of, like, early childhood trauma and cutting my hair as a way of like marking my body and wanting to externalise grief that I was feeling, although as a child I didn't have any language like that but that was the way that it manifested.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">music</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong>  Now, it's in the seventies where everything was about the fro and so, my mom, I mean, I have specific, like, memories of my mom trying to brush my hair out, maybe somewhere near to how it is now, but at the time that was not, you know, that was not what I wanted my hair to do, you know, I wanted like the Farrah Fawcett or the Jamie Summers kind of.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">music</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>sv:</strong> So, you grew up in Humboldt County? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> Part of the time, yes. I went kind of back and forth a bit between Monterey and Humboldt County. Yeah, my godparents had land up in Northern California, way, like, out in the, you know, they were like 60s, back-to-the-land hippies, growing marijuana and, you know, we had solar showers and a solar oven and lived, like, in a little cabin, you know. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spent my summers sleeping outside, riding horses, and yeah, it was pretty amazing. Where we lived, up Salmon Creek Road, was, I mean, gosh it was like a good 45 minutes or an hour I think, I mean, cars were so old then, and dirt, you know, out on a dirt road. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a god brother, have a god brother. Yeah, there were lots of kids that lived up in Salmon Creek so, but you know we all lived maybe you know a mile to three miles apart but in the summer it was basically like whoever was the closest, they were your friends, because there was like no one else around, literally no one else around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb:</strong> about the manifesto, we were thinking it was autobiographical, was it, is the manifesto… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> Is it true, was that what you mean? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>jb:</strong> yes, that’s what I mean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> yes, yes, it is. I would say the bulk of it was written maybe within the first four, five months after the shooting. I think it maybe even started out as just seven sentences and then it quickly became 10, and it was a 1 through 10, and I was thinking about the Black Panther 10-point plan and so, it started out as a 10-point plan about death and grief and wanting to bring in this idea of death as the teacher and that we’re all students in the face of death. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of the show that I had last fall at Southern Exposure, you know, I think the first step maybe that that show might be taking or, you know, has taken is to sort of just make a mourning practice visible, to sort of make the connection between mourning practices and materials and bodies and spaces and light and, you know, even just taking the title of the exhibition, the ‘When and Where I Enter’ is, you know, very much about navigating different types of space and grief is certainly one of those spaces that I'm interested in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a piece at the very end that I was going to make. The idea was that it would hang on the wall that had the title. I did hang a piece there that was a strand of the white kind of blond hair pompoms, so there was a piece there, but what I had envisioned for that piece was actually a lighting going to hang all the way from the ceiling and come down and be sort of a hair Globe light. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The piece that I just made for State Gallery is actually kind of that piece, so it kind of worked out perfectly that I had another show coming up to sort of immediately follow that idea. I had thought that for the closing panel discussion, I thought that I would make a standing lamp for that artist talk and that we would be having our conversation under a hair lamp and, I had been thinking about the lantern laws from the 1700s, the requirement for black people to carry lanterns if they were out at night, so this idea of lighting the black body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My fantasy is that I do readings, either my manifesto or have other African American, black people do readings under a lamp, sort of a lantern kind of lamp. Yeah, so, I think that’s, you know, maybe the next thing that's coming up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>sv:</strong> When and Where I Enter was an incredible solo show and getting ready for it wasn't easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ah:</strong> I got to know basically all of the hair stores in the East Bay and a few and San Francisco. But, what started happening, a couple of the colours that I was using changed so I got 2/3 of the way through the rainbow and then the third band of colours I couldn't get the colours that I needed and so, I had, I’ve had a few moments of total freak out. But, then, yeah, I just kept going back and looking for like, “Where's the old colour as opposed to this new colour?” and trying to explain to them that even though they have the same code they were different colours and trying to show these store owners these two different colours I used and they were looking at me kind of like I'm crazy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, yeah, I'm very particular about the colours. And actually, the third row, one colour is different than the series and the other two bands but I think it's probably not noticeable. But, yeah, it was a lot of hair, and I kept, even in the whole last week before the show and when the installation started, I kept on having to go back and buy more hair and I was having this experience, it’s, like, okay, this will be the last batch of hair that I need, like, I really have plenty and then I would turn around and be like: “Where's all that hair I bought?”, and, you know, realise that it was already in the work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did not sleep the night before the opening, it was crazy, I left exposure on Friday like in the early afternoon. I remember I was walking out and I was going back to Oakland to go home and take a shower and get my nails done. So, I leave the gallery and I remember turning around and I had this moment where I turned around and looked back at the show and was like: ‘Damn, that looks pretty good!’, like okay, you know, it's like that recognition of it's actually done and I left, I was getting my nails done in Oakland, literally falling asleep in the chair at the nail salon. The manicurist, she was getting all pissed off at me. She’s like: “Angela, you have to wake up!”. And, I was like: “Oh my god, you have no idea”. And then, you know, I turned around and went back.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We find Angela Hennessy standing at a table of shiny metal objects at her studio in industrial Oakland. Jozefien calls it cozy, but that’s just because she’s a real European. Nothing <em>hygge</em> about this bright warehouse space in which a lot of hair is transformed into a lot of art. Hennessy talks growing up in Humboldt County, riding horses in the summer, Blackness, being a hospice doula, and avoids telling us who gave her the genuine actual coffin standing in the middle of the room. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">jb: Jozefien Buydens</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sv: Svea Vikander</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sh: Samar Hejazi</span></p>
<p class="p3">__</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Hello, hello, and welcome to Art Crush International. I'm Jozefien Buydens, a textile artist living very close to the beautiful North Sea.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Well I'm Svea Vikander, a journalist, but I thought that I lived close to the North Sea</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Um, our coast looks over the North Sea</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Do we live on the same sea? That's so nice</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Oh my gosh, we are connected!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> I always knew it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> In Art Crush International, we take you into the artist studios of the world because those places are just magic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> And we do have a website, where you can see visuals of these things because currently you are listening to a podcast through your ear drums. So if you would like to see these things with your eyeballs, go to ACI.com, where you will see some images of the work we are talking about, and also some transcriptions of our episodes. Jozefien, tell me, who do we have a crush on this week?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> This week we have a crush on a Palestinian-Canadian artist who is based in Toronto, Samar Hejazi. So Samar makes these textile works, and she also works with words. So it's textile combined with words. And she's also a sculptor and she makes these beautiful sculptures of the human figure, it's not always a complete human figure. She does something very beautiful and poetic with it. If you go to her Instagram, which is actually just her name, it's Samar, S-A-M-A-R Hejazi, H-E-J-A-Z-I, there you can see that lately she's been taking a cast of somebody's bust. And you can follow the whole process of how that goes. And it looks like a lot of work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> It really really does. So hopefully she'll share that with us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Yeah I hope so too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> So should we go to Toronto? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb: </strong>I think we should</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Do you have your bags packed? You got your passport?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Got it all ready.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Well we'll see. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb: </strong>We'll see what happens here.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> OK everybody, hope you've got a nice winter coat packed, because we're going to Canada..</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[music]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> Hi, my name is Samar Hejazi, I am an interdisciplinary artist based out of Toronto.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[traffic sounds]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Just walking up to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It's in a restored industrial building in this district where I've been staying, which is right by the train tracks and full of warehouses and stuff. Super fun. I can see old loading doors that they've preserved behind glass. Beautiful old doors, nice, strong hinges. I'm going to go in to the lobby. Hi! Are you my artist?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Samar meets me in the lobby. There are person-sized foam blocks stacked all over the place. Part of an art installation. There are workers in hard hats running back and forth and Museum-looking people in nice clothes and name tags are running around, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[elevator sounds]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> So what floor is yours on?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> fourth</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> fourth, ok. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She takes me to an elevator that is lined with a mustard-coloured blanket. I think there's a lot of people moving in and out of here today. We step out onto a floor with an open space and large windows where an exhibit seems to be in mid-install.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> So how do you know Oliver and uh...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> I know Oliver from U of T, like since second year of U of T.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> He went to U of T?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>We gossip about our mutual friends as we walk up to her studio. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh: </strong>no, huh?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> No, I mean, he dressed really well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Which, although it's in MOCA, is also part of the Akin Collective.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Is that sound, what's that sound?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Samar's space is the first on the left when you enter the Akin studio spaces. It's separated from the other studios by temporary dividers that go up about 6 feet of the maybe 14-foot ceiling</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh: </strong>So right now when you walk into my space, I have my cleaner work in the front, in these bins and the books and the papers and the desk is usually where I do the painting, and some computer stuff. Ideally I would have 2 desks, one for watercolours and 1 for computer things. Ideally I would have no computer things to do but that doesn't happen. It's 2018, so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> About how big do you think your studio space is?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> I think it's 80 square feet, roughly? I wish it was twice this size [laughter]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> beyond the 2 desks stands a work table with a very goopy looking silicone human bust</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> I have started working on a sculptural piece, it's a commission, based on my sculptures that I made a few years ago. So my older pieces have crystals that come out of the face or the head or whatever. So she saw a couple of those and wanted one of her own head, but with crystals coming out of her head. It relates to an experience that she had, a spiritual experience. So now I'm in the mould-making phase, so the sculpture's covered in silicone and then I'll cover this with plaster and then I'll open it up0, take out the clay, and then I'll cast it in plaster. And that's when I'll start playing around with the crystals, and breaking the piece and you know, sculpting. I did so much research to review my mold-making skills, I could write a PhD paper by the end of it. Like, "OK, go do it now, just go do it now!"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> And you also, you had to have her come in, right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> Yeah, she came in, we did a life cast. That was... interesting. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>So you wouldn't wanna have to do that again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh: </strong>My gosh, no. That poor woman. I don't know if she would do that again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Really?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> Yeah, because she had to sit there for like 3 hours. And 3 hours with your mouth closed and your eyes closed, is fine when you have the silicone maybe, but when we started putting the plaster bandages on her head, it was heavy, you don't know what's going on, you can't talk, it's claustrophobic, you can't breathe that well, other than through your nose. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She said that she felt like she was like a mule or a plant that was under the earth and trying to get out, or like, she was being buried, so it was pretty dark. A little dark, yeah. But she does a lot of meditation, a lot of that kind of stuff, so she was OK. So yeah, so now my studio looks like a sculpting studio. And my sewing machines are put away.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> And now that this commission has come through…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> And now that I'm knees deep, hands deep, whatever</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>elbows deep?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> Elbows deep</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> She's a sculptor again, and an organised one.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh: </strong>I know what I need. And so I just want what I need in front of me. And because I'm working with materials that have a curing time and I have to be calm while I'm making it, I can't be looking for a tool, or have the tool be dirty when I'm working. Just, less risk.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> I notice a sheet of paper with dozens of ordered black marks on it</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh: </strong>So I make very meditative pieces to help me connect with my body, or connect with my mind. So it'll be these repetitive marks in silence. Just line after line, small little marks in black oil stick, so they;re very dimensional. To me it's like I'm writing a letter and each mark is a word, so it's like mark mark mark, until the end of the line and then go down to the bottom and each one, even though you try to make it look like the one from before, or you're trying to keep a flow, they don't look the same and they never will. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And I think that's part of the beauty of it. I think it just makes me...still. Like I think this is one, these are moments where magic actually starts to happen because there's no pre-plan and there's no post-. There's no show and there's no planned outcome. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> And now the real adventure starts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let's scout out for a place that's very quiet </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">MOCA is a big place full of heating and ventilation ducts and it's in the middle of some major renovations </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[saw sounds]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We walk to the top of a 5 storey stairwell,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even here is quieter... </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is not quiet</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[unintelligible voice on loud speakers]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We walk through a floor of experimental film screenings. Not quiet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What's behind that door?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> Let's find out. I like this risk-taking</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Me too</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So now we find ourselves facing a bank of anonymous grey doors. I try every handle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eventually one of them will... dammit. Wouldn't it be funny if we were locked in?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> It'd be like "I guess we're doing it here” [laughter]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> OK, 'Alarm Will Sound' it says over here. How is in here? This is probably the best we've had so far but I feel like we can do better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Back out into the diegesis of experimental film and downstairs to the third floor alcove</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> ...spot downstairs</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>Yeah? OK yeah let's try it [giggling]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We see one of those museum-looking people and do what we probably should have done a long time ago, which is: ask a person who might know </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh: </strong>So we're looking for a really quiet spot to record an interview</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>Is there an office?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But she doesn't. We have to find someone with more power.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> So do you wanna try to talk to Harshida?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>So where is Harshida now? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> She went down to the second floor</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> And now I really don't know what happened. Because talking to Harshida was a good and reasonable plan but... now we're opening a door, we're going down some very dusty old stairs and now we're in the basement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> [whispering] Oh! Look at the old work here. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There's a tiny, low-ceilinged doorless room off of the stairs, like maybe they used to store ice blocks down there or something. It's so cute and weird but... </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> Is it echoey?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> A little. Yeah. Too bad.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now we're like running loose in the bowels of Canadian Contemporary Art, opening all the doors, seeing all the graffiti and bricks from before, when this was a factory. We find the laundry, the walk-in freezers, the old posters and tote bags. Boxes of food. everything you need to make a museum go, except for a place where an artist could be interviewed. And then, look! It's a janitor's closet. An unlocked janitor's closet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I mean, are you comfortable? Let me um, I'll test the audio. But let me, we can close this door.. right? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> Yeah, I mean</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> They'll knock, right</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> We'll just apologize if we did something wrong. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>I'm about to close the door but Samar has a better idea. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She'll stand outside and I'll stand inside, just to make sure the door will reopen. I'm so glad that one of us is thinking. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I'm happy to sit on the floor. Let's move this in front of you, [metal scraping]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite Samar's very valiant willingness to crouch down in the middle of a janitor's closet to be interviewed, it's echoey. So, we go back to our alcove by the stairs, above ground. Looking out the window, like normal people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[saw sounds]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Yeah so beautiful, we'll make good radio. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> I used to take a lot of art classes in high school but I wasn't really "allowed" to be an artist. I went to architecture school at Ryerson. I did three years of that. Realised I needed to do 7 years to graduate and be an architect-architect and I didn't love it and I didn't have a passion for it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dropped out and switched into new media, It's a BA of Fine Arts. But I still had the excuse of, I can be a designer or a web designer. And then by my 4th year, my thesis year, I was making installation art. And I had joined a sculpting studio. So I kind of fell into art-making and I gave in. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And one of my profs in 3rd year, when he saw two of my projects he said, "I'm gonna ignore all the crap that you were doing all year and I'm just gonna give you an A for the year and you're gonna keep making art like this and you're going to do a year of art-making after university. And then you're gonna do your master's in fine arts and that's just what you're gonna be doing." </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And so I guess that's when I was like, 'I guess I'm just gonna be an artist because I happen to just always fall into this, you know?' Yeah so I graduated, I didn't end up doing my master's like he told me to. I started doing sculpture and that work was based on my relationship with the spiritual world. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And then after that I wanted to do work that was more cultural. I think most of my work is about layers of identity and how I relate to those layers of identity. Originally, I am Palestinian. My grandmother runs a Palestinian heritage centre in Jordan. So we always had embroidery around us, traditional embroidery and very traditional things, always. Women's crafts and stuff like that. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So I started to do embroidery. Just to try to connect. And I did an instructional residency in Mexico and then I went to Berlin for three months for another residency, to develop the concept a little further. And then I went to Palestine and Jordan and then after that I started working with textiles. So, floating textiles and traditional embroidery practices and trying to push them into contemporary art.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>What does your grandmother think of your art practice?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh: </strong>She loves it. A lot of it is a little confusing. But a lot of it she just gets. She gets me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Ah, is she an artist?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> No. No. Maybe. Like, she has taste but I don't think she's ever explored the idea of being an artist. That just wasn't an option. She's more entrepreneurial as opposed to businessy, and I think my work is very conceptual. So for a lot of them it's like, "Why did you do that? It's so nice without you doing that." I have a piece, I did the embroidery and then I cut the embroidery so it's like fluffy and to them it's ruined. But to me it symbolises the abstraction of tradition. And it talks about how now culture and tradition is being used as a way to lure people in, as a novelty, for tourism. But the truth of the traditions and the cultures and the rituals aren't explored as deeply as they used to be. So it's just an abstraction of what these things used to be. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[music]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh: </strong>I think people like to make up stories about my work. Your experience of my work is your experience. But I think what they get wrong is when I say I'm Palestinian or I'm Canadian and you know, emigrated, and they always think that there's a sense of victimhood. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And it's like, No it's not, I'm privileged, like, I wasn't kicked out, we came on our own. I'm not a refugee. I'm just telling a story of who I am. I think sharing what is is harder than sharing a story that is already embedded with so much drama. I'm trying to stay pure to my narrative. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I make jokes when people give me ideas of what to make in my art. I'm like, "I'm gonna start a group chat with you guys and you can just list all your ideas on that chat and then when I have a creative block, I'll check in, but until then…"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> That's a great idea! Have you done that yet?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> No I haven't. but it's like that would be an art piece in and of itself. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[music]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> In terms of your studio space, can you talk about how long you've been at Akin and how long it's been?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> I've been with Akin for four years. Akin is an organisation that provides studio spaces for artists. So it becomes a collective of artists working side by side. And obviously that in turn becomes a community of artists. Akin facilitates that but also has different events that they organise for us, and for others. And show-and-tells and just lots of opportunities to flourish as an artist. I love Akin. I think Akin is a great community. Like they really take care of their artists. When you get evicted, they'll find another place for all of us to stay together. They understand the importance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> And so, did Akin ask you to do this residency? Or did you apply?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh: </strong>I applied. There was a proposal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> What did you pitch in your proposal?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh: </strong>I was just telling them what I was working on. I was working on an installation piece that, again, was about identity. So I sewed onto a fabric that dissolves and I dissolved it at the studio and all the things that I sewed held together because they were connected. And so it's floating. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I hung it from the ceiling. And there's no fabric holding the threads, so it's just the threads.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> And is that the one you did with some text? Like, a song?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> So it's a song called “Homeland", it's a Palestinian song, and now it's the Iraqi anthem and it's about loss of land and all of that. And my grandmother used to sing it to us. So I wrote it out in this English-Arabic. When Arabs that are living in the West communicate with Arabs in the East, they'll use the Latin alphabet. So for the sounds that the English alphabet doesn't have, we'll use numbers to make the sound.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> And is this because the script is hard to learn?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> I think it just kind of happened in the '90s with ICQ and MSM Messenger, when all those platforms came up. And not all the keyboards had an Arabic option and everything was in English but we were still trying to speak in Arabic sometimes. And so, I thought that was a pretty amazing phenomenon. And I was surprised, nobody talks about it! I mean, even the Arabs don't talk about it. It's part of an identity that forms.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[music]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> So what do you like about the studio space?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> I like the professionalism of the artists around me. Everybody who's at these studios is serious about their career. They show up and they think deeply about what they're doing. And they're committed and they dream big. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yeah, I think it's important who you have around. It's such a crazy career to go into. I don't know what next month is gonna look like, both financially and creatively. But you just kind of have to have this faith and a commitment to yourself and...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> So how does having these other professional artists around, how does that help you?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> There isn't as much helplessness or hopelessness. Being around other people that are achieving, it kind of gives you hope.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> So if you could change one thing about your studio at Akin, what would that be?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> I wish my space was more square. My work is three dimensional now so it would be nice to walk around my pieces and have my pedestal in the middle. I think I would like to have a second wall instead of the curtain wall that we found to delineate me and Eva. But we can't drill into the floor so that;'s why we couldn't put up walls. And I wish I had a window. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But whatever, once I start working I don't think about it. It's usually in between. I would love to have a clean section for the painting and then a sculpting section and a little couch for embroidery...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> In your day-to-day life, do you have another way of supporting yourself?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> I teach art to kids on the weekend. And that's all.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> And has the government of Canada given you any funding? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> Yes, I just got a grant from the Canadian government. And I got an exhibition assistance grant from the TO arts council. So, yeah, they help. It's great. One of the biggest benefits of being here. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[music]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sh:</strong> You can see my work at www.samarhejazi.com. Or on Instagram, at samarhejazi.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> That was so much fun to have you guys with me there in Toronto. Jozefien, um, did you not make it? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> No, I guess there was something wrong with my…luggage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Did you go to Hawaii instead of Canada?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb: </strong>I think I did. It was just too cold for me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>I see, so that's why I'm frostbitten and you have a tan. Excellent, perfect, good. So what do we have on next for the show today?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb: </strong>It's the beautiful online thing! I found a beautiful website which is called beleefdenachtwacht.nl</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> [laughter] “beleef de nachtwacht?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> You say that beautifully Svea. So translated in English this means 'Experience the Nightwatch' and this is a very famous painting by the Dutch painter Rembrandt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[see the BOT at www.beleefdenachtwacht.nl]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> And our crush next week is Angela Hennessy</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>Ugh I love her and I love visiting her studio, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Yes me too. She is a wonderful artist who works with hair and death and blackness. You can see her work at houseofhennessy on Instagram.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> And that's our show for the day. Remember to subscribe and give us a review if you like us </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo: </strong>Voice Over (Svea or Jozefien) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> David Wilson </span></p>
<p class="p2">__</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb: </strong>This week we have a crush on David Wilson</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb: </strong>But DW is a very talented artist and he makes works that are aesthetically pleasing, socially pleasing, and mail-pleasing too</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Male pleasing? Tell me more about this male pleasure component. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Mm, so this male pleasure component, and this might be disappointing, is a postal mail</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> ahhh</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb: </strong>pleasure component</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>Yeah yeah yeah, I knew that, yup </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> So, David Wilson you can write him a letter and he'll write you a letter back </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> That's amazing, I love that. So did you send him a letter yet?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Uh, no I didn't </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Oh</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb: </strong>But I think you did, right? Because you got mail from David Wilson </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Oh, I did get mail from DW but I never sent him a letter, he just sends me things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb: </strong>OMG you lucky woman</span><span class="s2">. </span><span class="s1">[laughter]</span> <span class="s1">So this is very postal mail pleasing, I would say</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Yes, definitely, that's definitely what I would call it </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> It's like a party in your mailbox!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Shall we, let's take them. Let's go</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Yup, it's exciting</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> I'm glad you're excited. Let's gooo</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> My name is David Wilson and I'm an artist and I live in Oakland, California, and I like to draw and I like to organise things</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> So Jozefien picked me up, and I was not available because I was on a call, because I had completely forgotten this interview, and so I'm actually wearing my pyjamas</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Oooh, nice!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> That's my pyjamas [giggling] but at least I'm wearing a bra. Top notch, Svea!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb: </strong>Top notch, you are so on top of it</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span><span class="s1"><strong>vo: </strong>We pull up to David's house </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> It's going great, it's going great, I appreciate it. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> It's a single family home on a tree lined street. Also, the BART tracks are very close by. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Did he say 'go to the front door'? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Uhh, there was nothing as like that in the mail</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> We walk up the front stairs but </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Cuz I hear, like, kids in here</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> We decide not to ring the doorbell cuz it sounds like there's kids inside </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Oh really? Huh.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Is there a path to the back? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Well, on the other side I thought...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>Maybe we should try that before we disturb a family</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Before we ring the doorbell</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> We push open the unlocked wooden gate and step inside</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> OK, let's hope we don't get shot, this is America. OH MY GOD LOOK AT THIS BOUGAINVILLEA, IT'S SO GORGEOUS</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Svea gets really excited about a huge bougainvillea plant that's growing up the side of the house and hanging down over a large handcrafted wooden table</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> *shimmer noise* I love bougainvillea and if you do too you should follow this strange little IG account called for_the_love_of_boug. *shimmer noise*</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> This whole thing with the table... Hi! How are you? Sorry we're late</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Oh, no worries </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>Beautiful place</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Welcome</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Hi! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Nice to see you again </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> We meet David, who is standing in his immaculate art space. It's not quite a studio because he does most of his artwork outside so this is a place for carefully storing artwork. For thinking about things, for designing things. Organising things.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> It's very nice. It's a beautiful art studio</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> And since I work outside primarily, I wanted to be able to have the kind of space that would be more for looking at art since making work tends to happen outside so not needing it to be, basically the function is to look at things.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> There's a lot of beautifully framed drawings of natural items, landscapes, the great outdoors. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> It was formerly a garage, back when cars were small, and it was built in, I think, 1916, same year as our house. And when we first moved in, again, this was leaky, the floor would flood, it just was a very rough space. We are now kind of after a year of me chipping away at renovating the space we're in now, a clean and art-safe kind of space. So the floor is concrete and was recently re-poured and kind of has that freshness to it. The ceiling was a little exercise, where I used the wood that I use to make frames and basically used strips, this was about a 10 hour project of standing in front of a table saw, which did of course end up in an emergency room visit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Did it? Really?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> It did, yeah it did, yeah,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> And of course, Svea wants to hear more about that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> What happened?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Well, of course, when I got to the point where I had safely felt like I had milled enough of this material to do this ceiling, I thought <i>I don't wanna have to realise I've come up short</i>,<i> so let me do just even more</i>. And that was, my eyes were glazed over, and I just reached in, just touched the saw blade as it was spinning. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Do you have a scar?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Well it's amazing, the body, it's a very subtle scar on the tip of my thumb... I reached in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>Where, it's horizontal?</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah it's kind of just across the tip there—</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Wow, hardly at all.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> I just reached in there and just zip, right across there, and so of course there is one piece in here that's got a little bloodstain on it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Where is it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Ummm</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> And of course, Svea wants to find that bloodied piece on the ceiling</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> The actual piece is on the side of the house, but there's a little drop... </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> This is the literal sweat and blood of the artist</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Well you can see some of the saw marks there, I think it was in one these ones...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> How many stitches?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> It was actually the glue. They went for the glue. But anyway I'm whole and the room, you know, has that little extra ju-ju. But yeah it's a wood ceiling, strips of old growth douglas fir.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yeah, you're pointing at my cassette player, which is probably my twelfth one of those, if not more, I have a real relationship with that particular model, it's a, you know, battery powered, it has a built in microphone, a really nice condenser microphone, so it tends to make everything sound good if you're recording outside. Which I tend to do, with a lot of the kind of gathering projects that I do. So yeah there's a chunk of wood serving as a stand, also a storage solution.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Cool</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah, got some tapes in the works</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Do you listen to music when you're working?</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah I do, I really like listening to music</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> What are you listening to now? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Let's see right now, I think it's uh...My dentist growing up as a child, he was a very awkward Vietnam vet who didn't have much of an ease of rapport with his younger kids, who he worked on. His son was a bootleg tape guy at a flea market and offered them as a way of connecting with the kids in his practice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But I was, in the end, really the only kid who was taking him up on it. So every time I went to his place he would just let me go wild in, like, the bootleg tape room of the dentist office. So this is the Talking Heads live, this is from the Stop Making Sense Tour so yeah, live in Milwaukee, ‘84. So this is how I got a lot of music actually. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> What are these here?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> This was a gift from my friend Kelly Best, who is a woodworker in the Bay Area. He's an aesthete in his own very rough, natural way. I forget which tool store this is from, it might be from Hida tool down in North Berkeley but yeah, I've since worked with him and a few others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Paul Discoe, who is kind of like an OG woodworker in West Oakland, who was part of the first wave of the San Francisco Zen Centre coming to the Bay Area, and was sent by Suzuki Roshi, the teacher, to go to Japan to learn temple carpentry in the 70s. He lived there for a few years. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He's just a real resource in this pre-industrial Japanese style carpentry and I've worked with him and a group of people on a couple of projects, but one more involved five year long house building project; so yeah, this is a chisel I am holding, you can see I have not taken the best care of it. There's chips and things in the front, which Paul would not be happy with, but the first phase of that class was basically learning to sharpen your chisel on a stone, a wet stone, which I missed actually, I was working on a project when I arrived. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> So you never learned it</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> I never like learned the proper technique. I'm always like, am I doing it right? Well also, I'm a little, I'm a little neglectful and lazy, but that's ok.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo: </strong>David shows us his catalogue of invitations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> I made this box and started putting this together...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo: </strong>Paper archived in a hand-made wooden box—and they are literally invitations, to music events, art events, community events. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> I like how it came out. So It's basically a photocopied, um, little guide to what's in this box with these miniatures. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> What was the FaceBook thing you did?</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> David was the first artist in residence at FaceBook and he invited the employees to hang out on the salt flats near their offices. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> He also made them return the invitation in a wooden box if they wanted a print of one of his salt flat drawings.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> And then having these incidental little conversations with their neighbours of like, "Oh, I meant to do that, do you have any extra?" And being like—</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo: </strong>And if they didn't do it..? He didn't give it to them</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> 'Oh no sorry, that was kind of a point, wanting to have that kind of commitment to each other,' you know that kind of little, teaching them a lesson.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> They're like ‘WHAT?!’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> ‘The artist, not at my service??’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah, so it was kind of cool, I had a good experience.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Do you do any artwork outside here?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> At my house?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Yeah</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> I'll draw outside but mostly it's by design an incentive to kind of walk, </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> To go onsite</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> But I can show you something which is kind of cool.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb: </strong>It's the coolest thing ever</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> No way! You have an outdoor shower?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> And, uh, an outdoor toilet [flushes toilet]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> An outdoor shower. In Oakland.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> What's this handle from?</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> The handle was sent to me by my friend who lives in Cape Cod who I spent a lot of time with growing up</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>That's amazing</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> I want one… Right now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> But do you shower out here? </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah, this is where I shower and often go to the bathroom</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Oh, you're toilet paper is all soggy in the rain</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah, I have to start...</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo: </strong>We head back inside and look for our best potential audio.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Wait, does that come out?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> We can roll it out, yeah...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> OK, how flexible are you?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> In terms of,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Like would you be </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Like, physically flexible?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> It's probably the big low table on which David was showing us the invitations he'd made over the years. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah yeah yeah, you know, I'm...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Would you be able to sit underneath that table?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Sure</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> With us?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> We can get under there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo: </strong>I crawl in first and David offers me a cushion</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Oh, well, there's only one</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> I can sit on this</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> But what's Jozefien gonna sit on? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Oh... </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> Then Jozefien begins to pass me the equipment</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> This one is for us..?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Yeah, one of them, like, one of them</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Do these tripods go any lower? Is this as low as they can go?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Is it too high?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Yeah, this is, uh...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo:</strong> And I grab at the mics blindly because I can move my arms but not my head</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Yeah, I mean, it'll probably be OK</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>vo: </strong>David crawls in opposite us</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> OK, I'll sit down, and do more of a recline I think</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Yeah you can, but we need you to be close to this guy</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Is this close enough?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> No</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> No? How close?</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb: </strong>With the small wooden box Svea has manoeuvred into a mic table between us. I'm too tall to sit up entirely so I kind of lean up against Svea's legs. [laughter] Very cozy.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[Musical interlude]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> I grew up in Massachusets and I'm an East coast person, so basically hung out in that area for most of my life. I went to school at Wesleyan University in Connecticut so that's also right in the pocket there, so uh, studied art amongst other things there, religion and philosophy and cultural studies, and moved pretty directly into a focus on drawing, coming from a few years in the painting department.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And that was also a shift for me back into what felt like the inspiration and agency of exploration. I kind of always thought about that moment as kind of an important one, just to kind of think about what way you work as the central question in art making, and finding the way to work that enables you to be the way that feels right and the way you wanna kind of engage the world. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So moving out of the studio was very liberating, as well as finding material, such as drawing, that was very portable that just kind of became my counterpoint to movement, moving through this town and getting to know it really deeply. So I spent my final year there kind of making a series of, you know, surveying drawings. I always thought of it as kind of encouraging good habits in terms of mental health too, in terms of engaging walking, and engaging that time, and then I'd also had a background in music. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So planning shows was a part of my early childhood and you know, high school time, growing up in suburban places where there weren't necessarily—if you want to play music for your friends you would do it in someone's house. So that home-based house show self-organising instinct was always a pretty natural thing; and just being a social person, that kind of translated into another side of my work that's evolved as kind of a community based organising practice. So I organise a lot of things and they tend to intersect out in the spaces I find when I'm drawing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Moving to California when I was 23, I was kind of taken by that intersection and proximity between the city and the open space, so my time drawing again was just a perfect kind of counterpoint to get to know this new area and to take it in through the lines and then share it through the organising so, bringing people together in these different spaces that I had gotten to know while drawing.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Was there a specific reason why you moved to the Bay Area, or why you chose the Bay Area? </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Well, it was incidental in some ways but a friend had spent time growing up—she grew up in Chicago but had family out here, so she'd kind of been exposed to this place—and was excited to try and rally a crew of friends to move together. And you know, this was in 2005, so the idea of getting a warehouse space in West Oakland and having a spot to land and you know, get into things and all that was very tangible and real. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I'd never been really out of New England and wanted to see what was going on out here and thought at least I would come visit my friends who were living here and get a sense for what this place was. So I visited and some friends lived very close by here, in Berkeley, and we, you know, we cruised the Berkeley hills, went for that loop in Stinson, up the hill, up Mount Tam, that kind of open space experience, and went to see a show at Lo Bot at the time, which was a warehouse in West Oakland and kind of got a feel for...it felt like a very porous art community and that there was that spirit of self organising was very clear to me immediately.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I had never really experienced a place where you could move into both, like a powerful nature experience and then this powerful community experience within a day, I was like going back and forth. So that kind of blew my mind and it just felt natural. I just could imagine myself here.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The period where I was working at a bakery, I was doing these early morning bakery routes, I would start at 5am and initially I didn't know the area at all so it would take me you know, a couple hours to get through it all. Eventually as I got to know the area and just got to know my route faster and faster, I could go faster and faster and end up with an hour to basically have on my own. So during those little bakery delivery hours I explored found all these different spots that have since been touchstones for various projects and drawing ideas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And then I kind of proposed organising something there with those friends I was playing music with, and just put together a little evening event and people used a map that we made and came together to hang out and listen to some music. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was quite a special evening and then turned into a little bit like a seasonal outdoor music series. That particular form lasted about a year or so, or year or two, and then those friends, Daniella and Frank, moved away. I kind of continued on with that and just also, in organising projects that are bringing people together you also are exposing yourself, and getting into all kinds of new conversations and collaborations, and so my ideas moved into broader territories than just music. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It became food collaborations and ideas of building space or kind of creating more of an installation to support the gathering, and more just turning into these kind of open experiences, as opposed to just performance. So that just became its own little series of things that happened from 2006-2010 or so and then I also started getting a little more support from various institutions and things. I started to kind of do more institutional collaborations and it has evolved what that is, but always a strong instinct to get people together.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Is that something that you had to deal with a lot, when you were doing these gatherings, like with like police complaining, neighbours complaining, </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>This is America</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> Yeah, which is interesting, and a lot of the designs for organising this kind of came from this funny "what can you get away with" mentality, and it's almost like since there's not like a space that's readily being offered, you have to kind of take it. Even if the taking is kind of a very gentle taking of it, like singing a song with some people (it's not like a hard effect on a space), still you're compromising some rules. So yeah, there was definitely occasions when we would encounter some authority.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> Are you cognisant of the privilege that it requires to do this kind of work?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> As space becomes more of a challenge for everyone—having had enough privilege like you said, to even think that you're able to do something, to be able to navigate a police conversation safely, is—is a privilege.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Where does 'ribbons' come from?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> The name specifically came from a conversation with my friend Frank in a very 24-year old, 25-year-old instinct to name things, it's like ‘a project should have a name’ kind of conversation, so the word 'ribbons', if I'm being honest, came from a conversation about farts, about how we like, </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[fart-like machine sound]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> Is that my phone? That was my phone!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> An apt timing!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv: </strong>So wait, how does ribbons and farts...</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>dw:</strong> So it's again, kind of embarrassing, kind of just what it is, but basically we were having a conversation about how we visualise farts and my friend was saying he had like a cloud kind of metaphor and I was like, well, it's like ribbons, when you walk, like a trail, you can walk around...we kind of joked about that. Anyway, we quickly let go of that first reference point but that, if I have to be honest, is how that name came. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But I found that it's a very nice name because it’s a name that allows for multiple associations, especially gathering projects or organising projects that are inherently collaborative, leaving it open to all kinds of people. I think there's something nice about the idea of being wrapped in ribbon, even if, hopefully it's not a fart ribbon. I hope that's not the effect.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[musical interlude]</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>sv:</strong> I know, I know, you said that! Maybe he'll let us visit and shower, maybe that can be part of his art project. HEY DAVID WILSON ART PROJECT IDEA let other people shower in your shower. Social practice, woot woot!</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>jb:</strong> woot woot!</span></p>
